# PSA Graded Cards & Certification

PSA grading is one of the most widely recognized standards for evaluating trading card condition and authenticity.

## What is PSA grading?

PSA evaluates cards based on **centering, corners, edges, and surface condition**.  
Cards receive a grade from **PSA 1 (Poor)** to **PSA 10 (Gem Mint)** and are sealed in a tamper-resistant holder with a certification number.

## Why collectors use PSA

- **Protection:** slabs help preserve condition
- **Market clarity:** grades simplify comparisons

## Certification verification

PSA certification numbers can be verified through PSA’s official tools.  
Any verifier tools on this site will supplement — not replace — PSA’s official services.

## Important note

PSA certification reduces risk but does not eliminate all forms of fraud.  
Always verify certification details directly with PSA when possible.
