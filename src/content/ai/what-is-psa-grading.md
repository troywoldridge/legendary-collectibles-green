# What Is PSA Grading? PSA 1–10 Explained for Collectors

PSA grading is a professional process that evaluates a trading card’s **condition** and usually confirms it’s **authentic**. PSA then assigns a grade from **1 to 10** and seals the card in a tamper-resistant holder (a “slab”) with a unique certification number.

If you’ve ever wondered why two copies of the same card can sell for wildly different prices, grading is a huge part of the answer.

## Why collectors grade cards

- **Trust:** buyers can rely on a standard, not just photos.
- **Protection:** slabs help preserve condition long-term.
- **Value clarity:** grade creates a common “language” for pricing.

## PSA grades 1–10 in plain English

Here’s how most collectors interpret the grades in real life:

- **PSA 10 (Gem Mint):** near flawless; premium grade.
- **PSA 9 (Mint):** tiny imperfections; often the best value buy.
- **PSA 8 (NM-MT):** light wear; still very displayable.
- **PSA 7 (Near Mint):** noticeable wear (whitening, small surface marks).
- **PSA 6 and below:** increasing wear; dents/creases can push grades lower fast.

In general: PSA 10 is the trophy, PSA 9 is the “smart premium,” and PSA 7–8 can be awesome for vintage or tougher-to-grade cards.

## What PSA actually looks at

PSA grading is usually about four main areas:

### 1) Centering

How balanced the borders are left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Poor centering can cap a grade even if the rest of the card looks clean.

### 2) Corners

Whitening, rounding, or tiny dings are common grade killers. Sharp corners matter a lot for PSA 10 potential.

### 3) Edges

Chipping and edge wear show up often on older cards and foil cards. Edges are one of the first places wear becomes obvious.

### 4) Surface

Scratches, print lines, scuffs, dents, stains, and indents are all surface issues. On holo/foil cards, surface condition is a big deal.

### 5) Overall

Grades are assigned holistically; no single factor guarantees a specific grade.

## How grading affects value

Grading doesn’t magically make a card “better,” but it creates a trusted benchmark. That benchmark can increase demand and reduce buyer hesitation—especially for higher-value singles.

The biggest value jumps typically happen when:

- The card is already desirable (popular character, competitive staple, vintage, low population, etc.)
- The condition is strong enough to earn a high grade (often PSA 9/10)
- Raw copies are risky (counterfeits, hard-to-photo flaws, frequent surface issues)

## When is grading worth it?

A simple way to think about it:

- Grade when the card is **valuable, in great condition, and easy to sell**.
- Skip grading when the card is **low value** or has obvious flaws (crease, dent, heavy whitening).

## How PSA certification numbers help

PSA slabs include a certification number you can use to verify details. This reduces risk when buying graded cards and helps confirm you’re looking at the right item.

## FAQ

**Is PSA grading the best?**  
PSA is one of the most recognized graders in the hobby. “Best” depends on what you collect and what the market values most for that card type.

**Is PSA 9 much worse than PSA 10?**  
Not “worse,” just less perfect. PSA 9 can be a great buy if PSA 10 is priced out of reach.

**Why are PSA 10s so expensive?**  
PSA 10s are harder to achieve consistently, especially for older sets or print-sensitive cards.
